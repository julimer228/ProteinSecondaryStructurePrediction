title: "The Protein Secondary Structure Prediction"

We have introduced a protein secondary structure prediction method based on the Logistic Regression classifier.

First, we need to load the data into the workspace

```{r}

  window_size=20;
  test_samples = create_samples(window_size, "test.txt");
  train_samples = create_samples(window_size,"train.txt");
  
  train_samples_CnotC = create_binary_samples(train_samples, "C");
  test_samples_CnotC = create_binary_samples(test_samples, "C");
  
  train_samples_HnotH = create_binary_samples(train_samples, "H");
  test_samples_HnotH = create_binary_samples(test_samples, "H");
  
  train_samplesEnotE = create_binary_samples(train_samples, "E");
  test_samplesEnotE = create_binary_samples(test_samples, "E");
  
  
      response_var <- "binary_class"
    results <- fit_logistic_regression(train_samples_HnotH, test_samples_HnotH, response_var)
    classifier_results[[class_name]] <- results
  
  
  
library(readr)
library(tidymodels)
  
  # logistic regression
  model <- logistic_reg(mixture = double(1), penalty = double(1))
  set_engine("glmnet") %>%
  set_mode("classification") %>%
  fit(y ~ ., data = train_samples_CnotC)

# Model summary
tidy(model)
  
```

```         
```

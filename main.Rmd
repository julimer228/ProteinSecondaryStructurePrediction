We have introduced a protein secondary structure prediction method based on the Logistic Regression classifier.

First, we need to load the data into the workspace

```{r}

  window_size=20;
  test_samples = create_samples(window_size, "test.txt");
  train_samples = create_samples(window_size,"train.txt");
  
  train_samples_CnotC = create_binary_samples(train_samples, "C");
  test_samples_CnotC = create_binary_samples(test_samples, "C");
  
  train_samples_HnotH = create_binary_samples(train_samples, "H");
  test_samples_HnotH = create_binary_samples(test_samples, "H");
  
  train_samplesEnotE = create_binary_samples(train_samples, "E");
  test_samplesEnotE = create_binary_samples(test_samples, "E");
  
```

```{r}
corelation<-cor(train_samples_CnotC[,2:443])
model<-glm(as.factor(binary_class)~.
```

```{r}
x=predict(model, type = "response")
x <- ifelse(x >= 0.5, "C", "~C")

ctab_train <- table(train$Class, train$pred_class)
ctab_train
```

```{, family=binomial, data=train_samples_CnotC)}
summary(model)
```
